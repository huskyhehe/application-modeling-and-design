# Final Project Requirements
The objective of this assignment is to learn to how to build an application in support of digital marketing activities. Your final application must consider the following use-case as shared with you per the pricing application we studied in 
great detail: 
- 1) A customer decides to browse and search for products and services that match their needs and wants. The system displaces bundled products and services (solution) as well as ads that match customer expectations. The prices must match the customer ability to pay. The product descriptions and ads must speak the customer language. In other words, for different customer types, even in the case of the same products and services, the system might display different prices, different market messages (bundled solution benefits) will be different. The system behaves differently depending on the customer type, market, and channel the user is coming through.  
- 2) Configuring products and services as solution bundles targeting different markets and channels. Markets, channels, and customer types are configured and populated as well.  
- 3) Autogenerate sales orders with different pricing options as well as product, people, markets, and channel perspectives.  
- 4) Generate reports to enable management to know sales revenues by market, channel, ads, and solution bundles.  
- 5) Generate creative ideas beyond the requirements.   

Your deliverable will be an application that will comply with the requirements above.
